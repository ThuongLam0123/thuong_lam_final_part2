What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?

- I do not have any experiences or knowledge about HTML/CSS/Javascript. I heard about HTML and Javascript before but I have never know exactly what that is.

Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?

- I used a template from scratch to start the portfolio.

What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)

- CSS and Javascript would be the most challenging part of my portfolio when some parts of its did not connect to my HTML file.

How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?

- I think it would be super hard to create a web. However, with the online free tool, I still can create a basic and easy web for me as I like.

What would you recommend to future students taking this class?

- I would recommend to start the porfolio as early as you can from what you have studied in the week so that you do not need to worry about the deadline and be able to creat a porfolio as you like.
